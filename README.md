# LearnWord
A simple Python app to help expand one's vocabulary through the use of **spaced repetition**.

Spaced repetition is similar to flash cards in the sense that data is repeatedely shown to the user until it is easily recalled from memory. The difference that spaced repetition employs is to refresh the user's memory on a particular piece of information before it is lost in memory. If something is easily recalled, spaced repetition assumes the user knows the data well and will not test the user on that particular piece of information for a longer period of time. If a user doesn't know that information or is slow to recall it, then spaced repetition will test the user on it again after a shorter duration. This learning method is highly effective for building a long-term working memory of particular pieces of information.

Using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) to build the list of words and their respective definitions.

### This app is not currently finished, but will be an accurate implementation of the spaced repetition learning method once complete.
